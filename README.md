# coviz19
Visualizing frequency of COVID19 testing using folium and publicly available data sources. Key ingredients right now include:

- The COVID tracking project's [API](https://covidtracking.com/api/)
- Statewide population figures from [worldpopulationreview.com](https://worldpopulationreview.com/)

## TODO
- Dump maps to some sort of "gallery" directory in the repo
- Some sort of positive cases per 1000 tests measure? (_A.K.A. some combination of cases per 1e5 scaled by testing frequency_)
- Look at availability of countywide data
- Ability to zoom back and forth in time
- Could this be a tiny static site?
